        <item>The park is located near Gimpo Airport, and that is the biggest downside. It, unfortunately, is not easy to reach unless you are already in that area. If you have some time before/after a flight, then check out Seoul Botanic Park!</item>
        <item>Olympic Park (올림픽공원) is a large garden located in the east of Seoul near Jamsil and Lotte Tower. The park can be reached easily from Jamsil, and is located only one stop away on the pink subway line at the Mongchontoseong stop.</item>
        <item>Naksan Park (san meaning mountain) is an often overlooked park located in the northern part of Seoul, very close to Dongdaemun. The park does require a walk up the mountain, but really the mountain is more alike to a large hill. It’s an easy walk and is not difficult.</item>
        <item>World Cup Stadium is made up of many smaller gardens that each have their own unique attractions. From the Nanji Hangang Park (a riverside park that runs alongside the Han River) to Hanuel Garden (which literally translates as ‘Sky Garden’), World Cup Stadium easily has the most variety out of all of the gardens on this list.</item>
        <item>Ttukseom Resort is a bit out of the way for most people, however, the park is definitely worth the short trip that is required. From the subway station, you can enter straight into the park.</item>
        <item>The park is situated on the banks of the Han River and is located very close to Ttukseom (another must-visit park!). Seoul Forest is best reached on the yellow line, just south of Wangsimni Station.</item>
        <item>Yeouido is another park that is very famous in Seoul. In spring especially (with the Yeouido cherry blossom festival), Yeouido Hangang Park is stunning.</item>
        <item>Namsan Park is somewhere that is visited by nearly everyone that comes to Seoul. But how many people have ever actually experienced the park? I would hazard a guess and say not many.</item>
